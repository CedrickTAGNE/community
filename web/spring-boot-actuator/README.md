# Make our Spring boot application Production ready: Unlocking Enhanced Monitoring and Management Capabilities


## Introduction

In the ever-evolving world of application development, delivering robust, reliable, and scalable software is a constant challenge. As developers, we strive to not only build applications that meet functional requirements but also ensure that they perform optimally and can be effectively monitored and managed. This is where Spring Boot Actuator comes into the picture.

Spring Boot Actuator (V2.x) is a powerful toolset that provides extensive monitoring, management, and operational capabilities to Spring Boot applications. With Actuator, developers gain unparalleled visibility into the internals of their applications, allowing them to monitor various metrics, health indicators, and runtime information in real-time. Moreover, Actuator facilitates seamless integration with popular monitoring systems and paves the way for efficient management of applications deployed in production environments.

In this article, we will embark on a journey to explore the vast array of features and benefits offered by Spring Boot Actuator. We will delve into the core functionalities it brings to the table and highlight how it empowers developers and system administrators to gain insights, diagnose issues, and fine-tune their Spring Boot applications for optimal performance.

Throughout the article, we will cover essential topics such as:

- **Core Functionalities of spring Boot Actuator**
- **Setting up Spring Boot Actuator**
- **Monitoring Application Metrics**
- **Health Monitoring and Readiness Checks**
- **Custom Endpoints and Metrics**
- **Security and Production Best Practices**
- **Integration with Monitoring Systems, Case of New Relic**

let's dive into the world of Spring Boot Actuator and unlock the enhanced monitoring and management capabilities it brings to the Spring Boot ecosystem.

## Core Functionalities of Spring Boot Actuator

    Spring Boot Actuator povides a rich set of features that empower developers and administrators to monitor, manage, and analyze their application effectively. It also give some capabilities and metrics that can help to keep a system Highly availlable if it's combined with other tools like Alarms and Load Balancers.
    In this section we will explore some of the core functionalities it offers.

### Predefined Endpoints

    Spring Boot Actuator comes bundled with a variety of built-in endpoints that expose crucial information about your application. These enpoints provide insights into metrics, health status, configuration details, logging, and more.

### Custom Endpoints
    
    In addition to the built-in enpoints, Actuator allows to create custom enpoints tailored to our application's specific needs. This feature allow us to expose additionnal metrics, health checks and management operations that are revelant to our application. This customization capability ensures that Actuator can adapt to our unique requirements and integrate seamlessly into our application's monitoring infrastructure

### Metric Collection and Monitoring

    Spring Boot Actuator provides comprehensive metrics collections and monitoring capabilities by collecting a wide range of metrics out of the box and providing vital information about our application's performance behavior. These metrics include HTTP request/response details, database interaction statistics, thread pool usage, cache hit rates, and many more.

    Furthermore, Actuator integrates seamlessly with popular monitoring systems like Prometheus, Graphite, and Micrometer, enabling you to visualize and analyze the collected metrics using powerful monitoring and alerting tools.

### Health Monitoring and Readiness checks
    Ensuring the health and readiness of our application is crucial, especially in production environments. Actuator's health endpoint provides a quick and convenient way to check the overall health of our application and its dependencies. It performs various checks, such as database connectivity, disk space availability, and external service availability, providing a holistic view of your application's well-being.




## Setting up Spring Boot Actuator

In this part we will go through the process of enabling Actuator in our Spring Boot project, exploring the configuration options available, and ensuring the appropriate security measures are in place.

### 1. Adding Spring Boot Actuator Dependency

Enabling Actuator in a Spring boot project is easy as adding a dependency to a project :). You can add it during the creation of you springBoot App or add it in an existing project Depending on wich package management you are using you can add it in `pom.xml` if you are using Maven or `build.gradle` if you are using Gradle.

#### Add Spring Boot Actuator From Spring Boot Initializer
from https://start.spring.io/, add dependency: 
![Add Actuator dependency from spring initializr](images/initializr-add-actuator) . (Tips: you can use the search bar to easily find it).
At the end you should have "Spring Boot Actuator" in your dependencies as shown on it image below.

### Add Spring Boot Actuator in existing Project

Depending of you package manager (Maven or Gradle), set you `pom.xml`or `build.gradle` as follow:

```
Pom.xml
<!-- Maven -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

```
// Gradle
implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-actuator'
```
